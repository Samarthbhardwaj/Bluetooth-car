Curently pursuing btech (Cse)

The aim of this project was to learn the basics of Arduino programming and hardware. The project involved creating a Bluetooth-controlled car that can avoid obstacles using sensors. The car was controlled by a smartphone app that sent commands via Bluetooth. The motor driver and the Arduino board were the key components of the carâ€™s circuit. This project helped me gain valuable skills and knowledge in the field of IoT and Arduino IDE.
